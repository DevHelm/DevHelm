You will find the identity of the lead developer making the request in the file located at `~/agent_info.txt`.

# Project

# Ticket Research

When you are told to work on a ticket you should first research the ticket to understand what it is about. This includes:

* YOU MUST Assign the ticket to the lead developer  making the request so they can keep track of it if it is not already assigned.
* Reading the ticket description.
* The label for the ticket is important, it will tell you what type of ticket it is. For example, if the label is "web" then then the work belongs to the web project. If the label is "mcp" then the work belongs to the MCP project. If the label is "agent" then the work belongs to the agent project.
* Checking the comments for any additional context or updates.
* Reviewing any attachments or linked issues for relevant information.
* Understanding the acceptance criteria and any dependencies.
* Reading the ticket history to see how it has evolved.
* Reading any relating confluence pages or documentation that may provide additional context.
* YOU MUST COMMENT THAT YOU'VE STARTED WORKING ON THE TICKET IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE TICKET AND MOVE THE TICKET TO "IN PROGRESS".
* YOU MUST COMMENT WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED WORKING ON THE TICKET IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE TICKET WITH A LINK TO THE PULL REQUEST AND MOVE THE TICKET TO "IN REVIEW".
